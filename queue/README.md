# Queue Data Structure

The queue is another fundamental data structure widely used in computer science!

### Description

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out 
(FIFO) principle. It's similar to a line of people waiting for a service: the 
person who joins the line first is the first to be served.

In a queue, elements are added at one end, called the "rear" or "back" of 
the queue, and removed from the other end, called the "front" or "head" of 
the queue. When you add an element, it gets placed at the rear end of the 
existing elements. When you remove an element, it's taken from the front, 
and the next element in line becomes the new front.

Queues support three primary operations:

1. **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
2. **Dequeue**: Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
3. **Peek**: Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.

Queues are commonly used in programming for tasks like managing tasks in 
a printer queue, handling requests in web servers, BFS (Breadth-First Search) 
algorithm implementations, and more. They're essential for handling processes 
in the order they arrive!
