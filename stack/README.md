# Stack Data Structure

The stack is one of the fundamental data structures in computer science!

### Description

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) 
principle. Think of it like a stack of plates: you can only add or remove plates 
from the top. 

In a stack, elements are added and removed from the same end, traditionally 
referred to as the "top" of the stack. When you add an element, it gets placed 
on top of the existing elements. When you remove an element, it's taken from the 
top, and the next element below becomes the new top.

Stacks support two primary operations:

1. **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.

There's also a third operation called **Peek**, which returns the top element of 
the stack without removing it.

Stacks are commonly used in programming for tasks like managing function calls, 
expression evaluation, undo mechanisms, and more. They're simple yet powerful 
data structures!
