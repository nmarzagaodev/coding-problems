# Bubble Sort Algorithm

One of the most popular sorting algorithms in computer science!

### Description 

This a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list 
element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping 
their values if needed. These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps 
have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. 
The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements 
"bubble" up to the top of the list.
